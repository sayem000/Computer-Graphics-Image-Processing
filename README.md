When the slope of a line exceeds 1, indicating a more vertical orientation, the standard Bresenham's algorithm may not perform optimally. This is because incrementing the x coordinate by 1 at each step could result in numerous iterations needed to cover the vertical distance between two points. To address this, we swap the x and y values when the slope surpasses 1, effectively rotating the coordinate system by 90 degrees. This adjustment makes the line less steep or more horizontal, enabling Bresenham's algorithm to be applied more effectively.
